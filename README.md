# 2040 Richmond Squadron Website

The website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator, and is hosted for free via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The simplest way to edit the site localy is with [docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Running `docker-compose up` from within the project folder will bring up the site. Then you just navigate to [localhost:4000](localhost:4000) and edit away.
